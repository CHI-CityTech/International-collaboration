## **Purpose**

This toolkit is designed to support high-level brainstorming sessions for administrative and organizational leaders exploring inter-institutional collaboration. The focus is to facilitate open-ended, imaginative, and wide-ranging discussions that yield a rich list of ideas, opportunities, and potential partnership pathways. No idea is too small, too ambitious, or too speculative at this stage.

Participants are encouraged to consider:

1. What types of collaborative, thematic, or institutional activities do they envision?  
2. What strengths, resources, or unique opportunities can their unit bring to the collaboration?

## **AGENDA FRAMEWORK**

### **I. Welcome & Framing**
- **Introductions**
- **Overview of Goals**
- **Expectations**: Emphasize that this is a brainstorming session—divergent thinking is encouraged; convergence comes later.

### **II. Thematic Brainstorming Activities**

Use one or more of the following tools to guide idea generation:

#### 1. Digital Whiteboard Clusters
- Break the session into topical themes (e.g., AI and Ethics, Climate and Design, Student Mobility, Shared Curricula).
- Invite participants to post ideas, questions, or provocations on shared digital whiteboards.

#### 2. Speed Collaboration Pitches
- In pairs or rotating small groups, participants deliver 1-minute idea pitches.
- Prompt: "What is one possible collaborative project you'd love to see happen in the next year?"

#### 3. Resource Exchange Board
- Divide into "We Have" and "We Need" columns.
- Participants list tools, platforms, labs, student bodies, or expertise they can offer or are seeking.

#### 4. Collaborative Archetypes Gallery
- Present a list of sample collaboration types (see below).
- Invite participants to annotate or extend the list with context-specific applications.

### **III. Institutional Strengths Roundtable**
- Each participant shares 1–2 key institutional strengths, resources, or unique capabilities.
- Prompt: "What does your unit or institution do particularly well that could support or inspire collaboration?"

### **IV. Sample Collaboration Types to Seed Brainstorming**

Participants can build on or remix these ideas:

- Guest Lectures (live or recorded)  
- Parallel Class Activities  
- Joint Research Projects  
- Shared Lab or Studio Access (including virtual labs)  
- Virtual Symposia or Mixers  
- Co-authored Publications or Grants  
- Faculty Exchange or Mentorship Programs  
- Interdisciplinary Challenges/Competitions  
- Co-taught Modules or Joint Degrees  
- Shared Open Educational Resources  
- Student Exchange or Study Abroad Tracks  
- Entrepreneurship & Innovation Incubators  
- Joint Digital Repositories or Archives  
- Community-Engaged Projects  

### **V. Reflections & Emerging Patterns**
- Brief discussion on overlaps, unexpected themes, or compelling proposals.
- Identify 3–5 ideas that generated energy or curiosity.

### **VI. Next Steps**
- Propose forming a small working group to categorize and assess the brainstormed ideas.
- Establish follow-up timeline and shared documentation hub (e.g., Google Drive, GitHub, Miro).
- Optional: Schedule second session focused on clustering and prioritization.

---

## **Facilitation Tips**
- Use visual facilitation tools (whiteboards, sticky notes, digital canvases).
- Emphasize inclusion: everyone contributes, no matter their institutional seniority.
- Reiterate that quantity over perfection is the goal at this phase.

---

## **Outputs Expected**
- A compiled list of collaboration ideas (raw and unfiltered).
- A mapped matrix of strengths and opportunities.
- A commitment to further analysis and categorization.

## **Optional Appendices (for document adaptation)**
- Sample Templates (Idea Collection Sheet, Resource Exchange Grid)  
- Pre-session Questionnaire  
- Post-session Reflection Survey
