  [Zoom Collaborative Docs](https://www.zoom.com/en/products/collaborative-docs-b/)

**Two-Phase Input Strategy:**

1. **Prepared Contributions:** Participants are encouraged to arrive with a few ideas already formulated (typed, linked, or uploaded), such as previous proposals, research interests, or teaching initiatives.
2. **Live Free-Associative Brainstorming:** Participants are then prompted to enter spontaneous ideas sparked by the ongoing discussion. These may include types of collaboration, themes of mutual interest, and creative formats (virtual, hybrid, in-person).

**Suggested prompts:**

* What collaborations would excite you?
* What themes seem especially timely or promising?
* How might we imagine forms of collaboration we haven’t yet tried?

**Emphasis:** *No criticism or filtering.* Quantity over refinement. “No idea too silly.”

#### **3. Institutional Strengths & Collaborative Interests (15 min)**

* What does your institution bring to the table?
* What would your institution like to gain from such collaborations?
* How might these contributions become synergistic?
  Include:

  * Existing collaborations as examples
  * Ad hoc materials or support mechanisms
  * Begin informal list of possible faculty to involve

#### **4. Quick Assessment of Brainstormed Ideas (10 min)**

* Launch a simple **Zoom Poll** or in-doc voting tool
  - Participants express preliminary interest in ideas (not commitments)
  - Votes reflect curiosity, perceived feasibility, or alignment with strategic goals

#### **5. Closing & Next Steps (5 min)**

* Summary of the session (AI Companion will generate transcript and summary)
* Explain that all materials (whiteboard/doc, transcript, summary, poll results) will be compiled and shared
* Next meeting: A focused working group will analyze and cluster ideas for actionable follow-up


### **Post-Meeting Deliverables**

* Transcript of Zoom session
* AI Companion meeting summary
* Copy of Zoom Collaborative Doc
* Results from Interest Poll
* Shared summary document for review and prioritization


### **Framing Note to Participants (Optional)**

> "The goal of this session is not to make decisions or filter ideas, but to surface as many possibilities as we can. Collaboration can take many forms. We welcome vision, experimentation, and partnership of all sizes."
